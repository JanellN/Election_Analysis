## Summary

The script created was very helpful in analyzing the amount of votes per county per candidate, and can also be helpful in other election analysis as well.  The code can be refactored to analyze data from other congressional elections also.  If you were interested in learning more around the amount of votes each candidtate received in each county, we could add and IF statement that could produce this.  Also, if we are provided the data, we could learn more about the votes per party affiliation.
